# CountryApp

CountryApp is an Angular-based web application that utilizes the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com) to provide information about different countries. Users can search for a specific country to get details like population, area, and currency. Additionally, the app allows searching for countries by region or capital.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements installed:
- Node.js (Version 14 or newer)
- npm (Version 6 or newer)

## Setting Up the Project

To get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/secondary-jcav/countryApp.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd countryApp`

3. Install dependencies
`npm install`

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required as the application uses the public REST Countries API.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Features
